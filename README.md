# staticwebsite

creating a virtual server, deploy a web server onto it and configure networking and any necessary firewalls so that you can access the website.

###########Suggested steps:

1) Create a Git repository to store your work
2) Create (provision) a virtual machine (VirtualBox, Vagrant, etc.)
3) Research and choose a web server and install it on the virtual machine
4) Configure the web server to serve a static website (e.g. some basic HTML)
5) Make sure you can access the website in your web browser
Remember, youâ€™ll need to use automation.
